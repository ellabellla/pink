TYPES
literal = number
collections = tuple, matrix, meta
executable =  expression, expression_list
scoped_executable = exec, reduce, into, for_each
values = literals, executables, scoped_executables, indexed collections

DEFINITIONS
strict_definition = a name and an expression to reference
definition = a name and a setter type and an expression to reference
both resolve to the reference they are modifying/creating

EXPRESSIONS
operates on values

SCOPED EXECUTABLES
exec operates on:
- lhs = tuple
- rhs = expression_list, a reference to an exec or expression_list
reduce, into, for_each operates on
- lhs = tuple, meta, indexed_value, a reference to those types
- rhs = exec or reference to exec
